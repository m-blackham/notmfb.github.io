# Starting Point

The starting point is that foreign persons are taxed at a flat rate of 30% on their gross passive investment income and fully on *net* business profits coming from effectively connected income--effectively connected with the conduct of a US trade or busienss ("*ECI*"). While the starting point may seem severe, there are several exemptions to this general rule. Both capital gains (excluding estate gains) and interest from US based deposit accounts and "portfolio" debt are exempt from US taxation.

# Fixed and Determinable Income

Whether income that is not ECI income is subject to the flat 30% withholding is dependent on whether the income in question is "fixed and determinable." Rents, leases, interest, dividents, premiums, annuities, compensations, profits, royalties, and other *fixed or determinable* annual or periodic gains, profits, and income are all subject to withholding. Notably, the sale of property (capital gains) is excluded. This is partly becuase it is difficult for the buyer of property to withhold 30% from the seller's proceeds, because the buyer does not know the seller's basis or gain.
